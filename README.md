# facebookphishing
phishing of Facebook login credentials(N/B this is for educational purposes)

How it works:

-> The user inputs their Facebook login credentials and when they press submit, their details are captured and sent to a text file. (Screenshots of proof are included in the 'FB_PHISHING' folder) 

To try it out for yourself(FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!)

1. Get a free server or paid server to host the files in the 'FB_PHISHING' folder(assumption here is you know how to setup your files in a server)
2. Set-up a url from the hosting service.
3. Apply social engineering techniques from the link you've made and 'prank' your friends for fun e.g by sending a socially engineered email that would prompt them to open the link.
4. Credentials are stored in the 'fbacc.txt.' Open this text file to find the saved passwords(email/phone number + password)

I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH. THIS PHISHING EXAMPLE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ALONE!
